# Czytacz

An API RSS feed reader, implemented as a recruitment assignment.

## To run

```
$ poetry install
# Wait for stuff
$ poetry run api
```

## Notes

I'd probably go with [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) if I
started from scratch, but I forgot I was going to investigate them when I
started this.
